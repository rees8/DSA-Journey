## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `N` integers where each integer value is between `1` and `N`. Each integer appears exactly once except for `P`, which appears exactly twice, and `Q`, which is missing.</br>

Your task is to find `P` and `Q` and return them respectively.

## Examples

- Example 1:
  - Input:</br>
    4</br>
    1 2 3 2
  - Output: 2 4
  - Explanation:</br>
    Input: ‘N’ = 4</br>
    ‘A’ = [1, 2, 3, 2]</br>
    Output: {2, 4} - The integer appearing twice is ‘2’, and the integer missing is ‘4’.

- Example 2:
  - Input:</br>
    3</br>
    1 2 1
  - Output: 1 3
 
## Constraints:
- `2 <= N <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= data <= N`</br>
  Where `N` is the size of the array and ‘data’ denotes the value of the elements of the array.
